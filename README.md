# Time Tracker

Time Tracker is a stopwatch application that not only keeps track of time but also understands screen activities and generates usage logs. It is built using Python and leverages libraries such as tkinter for the GUI, threading for parallel execution, pygetwindow for window management, and json for data handling. This project was developed with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, serving as a test to understand the capabilities and power of AI in software development.
